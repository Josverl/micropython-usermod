    "Since micropython is a complete python interpreter, it is really easy to add new functionality to the hardware. However, there are cases, when defining the new functionality in python is not going to make the cut. First, the microcontroller might not have enough free RAM to compile the code, and second, the interpreter needs time for the compilation step, therefore, the execution of the instructions is slowed down. One can, in principle, gain on speed by implementing time critical code in assembly, and then invoking the `@viper` function decorator, but that has its own limitations. E.g., the number of positional arguments is maximised, and no keyword arguments are allowed, just to name a few problems.\n",

    "I start out with a very simple module and slowly build upon it. At the end of the discussion, we will create a general-purpose math library, similar to numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, numpy is a huge library, and we are not going to implement all aspects of it. But we will be able to define arrays on which we can do vectorised computations, work with matrices, invert and contract them, fit polynomials to measurement data, and get the Fourier transform of an arbitrary sequence. I hope you will enjoy the ride!\n",
    "\n",
    "One last comment: I believe, all examples in this document could be implemented with little effort in python itself, and I am definitely not advocating the inclusion of such trivial cases in the firmware. I chose these examples on two grounds: First, they are all simple, almost primitive, but for this very reason, they demonstrate an idea without distraction. Second, having a piece of parallel python code is useful insofar as it tells us what to expect, and we can compare the results of the C implemetation to that of the native firmware."
