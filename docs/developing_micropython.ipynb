    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you have somehow found micropython, fallen in love with it in an instance, broken your piggy bank, and run off, head over heels, to buy a pyboard. You have probably paid extra for the expedited shipping. Once the pyboard arrived, you became excited like a puppy with a bone. You played with the hardware, learnt how to access the accelerometer, switch, LEDs, and temperature sensor, and you have successfully communicated with other devices via the I2C, SPI, USART, or CAN interfaces. You have plugged the board in a computer, and driven someone crazy by emulating a seemingly disoriented mouse on it. You have written your own python functions, even compiled them into frozen modules, and burnt the whole damn thing onto the microcontroller. Then you have toyed with the on-board assembler, because you hoped that you could gain some astronomical factors in speed. (But you couldn't.)\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet, after all this, you feel somewhat unsatisfied. You find that you want to access the periphery in a special way, or you need some fancy function that, when implemented in python itself, seems to consume too much RAM, and takes an eternity to execute, and assembly, especially with its limitations, is just far too awkward. Or perhaps, you are simply dead against making your code easily readable by writing everything in python, and you want to hide the magic, just for the heck of it. But you still want to retain the elegance of python. \n",
    "\n",
    "If, after thorough introspection and soul-searching, you have discovered these latter symptoms in yourself, you have two choices: either you despair, scrap your idea, and move on, or you learn how the heavy lifting behind the python facade is done, and spin your own functions, classes, and methods in C. As it turns out, it is not that hard, once you get the hang of it. The sole trick is to get the hang of it. The fact that the micropython code base is organised in a rather logical fashion certainly makes matters feasible. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the following pages I would like to show how new functionality can be added and exposed to the python interpreter. I will try to discuss all aspects of micropython in an approachable way. Each concept will be presented in a minimal implementation that you can compile right away, and try yourself. At the end of each chapter, I will list the discussed code in its entirety, so that copying and pasting does not involve copious amounts of work. The code, as well as the source of the documentation are also available under https://github.com/v923z/micropython-development.\n",
    "\n",
    "I start out with a very simple module and slowly build upon it. At the end of the discussion, I will outline my version of a general-purpose math library, similar to numpy. In fact, when working on this math module, I realised that a decent programming guide to micropython is sourly missing, hence this documents. Obviously, numpy is a huge library, and we are not going to implement all aspects of it. But we will be able to define efficiently stored arrays on which we can do vectorised computations, work with matrices, invert and contract them, fit polynomials to measurement data, and get the Fourier transform of an arbitrary sequence. I hope you will enjoy the ride!\n",
    "\n",
    "One last comment: I believe, all examples in this document could be implemented with little effort in python itself, and I am definitely not advocating the inclusion of such trivial cases in the firmware. I chose these examples on two grounds: First, they are all simple, almost primitive, but for this very reason, they demonstrate an idea without distraction. Second, having a piece of parallel python code is useful insofar as it tells us what to expect, and we can compare the results of the C implemetation to that of the native firmware."

    "\n",
    "Before exploring the exciting problem of micropython function implementation in C, we should first understand how python objects are stored and treated at the firmware level. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Object representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you write \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = 1\n",
    ">>> b = 1\n",
    ">>> a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "on the python console, first the two new variables, `a`, and `b` are created and a reference to them is stored in memory. Then the value of 1 will be associated with these variables. In the last line, when the sum is to be computed, the interpreter somehow has to figure out, how to decipher the values stored in `a`, and `b`: in the RAM, these two variables are just bytes, but depending on the type of the variable, different meanings will be associated with these bytes. Since the type cannot be known at compile time, there must be a mechanism for keeping stock of this extra piece of information. This is, where `mp_obj_t`, defined in `obj.h`, takes centre stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at any of the C functions that are exposed to the python interpreter, you will see something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "mp_obj_t some_function(mp_obj_t some_variable, ...) {\n",
    "    // some_variable is converted to fundamental C types (bytes, ints, floats, pointers, structures, etc.)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variables of type `mp_obj_t` are passed to the function, and the function returns the results as an object of type `mp_obj_t`. So, what is all this fuss this about? Basically, `mp_obj_t` is nothing but an 8-byte segment of the memory, where all concrete objects are encoded. There can be various object encodings. E.g., in the `A` encoding, integers are those objects, whose rightmost bit in this 8-byte representation is set to 1, and the value of the integer can then be retrieved by shifting these 8 bytes by one to the right. In the `B` encoding, the variable is an integer, if its value is 1, when ANDed with 3, and the value will be returned, if we shift the 8 bytes by two to the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we do not have to be concerned with the representations and the shifts, because there are pre-defined macros for such operations. So, if we want to find out, whether `some_variable` is an integer, we can inspect the value of the Boolean \n",

    "```\n",
